They have been created for rare or new characters that cannot yet be shown, as they are not included in Unicode. Additionally, they are useful for language learning.<br><br>For example, if '亭' had not yet been included (although it has), it could be represented by '⿱⿳亠口冖丁'. It can also be compared to describing 'é' as 'e with an acute (upward) accent on it'. <br><br>Ideographic Description Sequences are formed by 12 description characters, ⿰ ⿱ ⿲ ⿳ ⿴ ⿵ ⿶ ⿷ ⿸ ⿹ ⿺ ⿻, and other already existing characters.<br><br>As they are graphical descriptions, they are subjective, and so a character might be described in more than one way, e.g. '刃' as '⿻刀丶' or '⿹刀丿'. Hence they do not indicate anything about how the character came to be formed (etymology). <br><br><b>Hanyo Denshi</b> refers to characters of non-Chinese (i.e. Japanese) origin, from the "General-purpose electronic information exchange environment maintenance program , character correspondence working committee material" dictionary non-published character material (March 2008 National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics)" (auto-translation).<br><br><b>Entity references:</b><br><b>Codes beginning with a '&'</b> (e.g. &CDP-88E2, for the sequence for '𥹐') are 'entity references' to characters in other databases than Unicode, such as the Chinese Document Processing (CDP) database (Taiwan). You can look up CDP characters at https://glyphwiki.org , e.g. Cdp-8b6c - https://glyphwiki.org/wiki/cdp-8b6c. When possible, these have been removed (see Acknowledgements).<br><br><b>Numbers within circles</b>, e.g. ⑫, indicate a character not shown, but having a certain number of strokes.<br><br><b>Acknowledgements:</b><br>Ideographic Description sequences are provided by the <a href=www.chise.org>CHISE</a> project, available at https://github.com/cjkvi/cjkvi-ids. <br><br>This dictionary uses a modified version of the sequences, with as many entity references exchanged for unicode characters as possible, at https://github.com/Transfusion/cjkvi-ids-unicode, by Transfusion.<br><br>Recursive decomposition sequences using <a href=https://github.com/KoichiYasuoka/IDSpiece>IDSpiece</a><br><br><b>Compilation</b><br>By lxs602, dictionary available at https://github.com/lxs602/Chinese-Mandarin-Dictionaries <br><br><b>References / Further information:</b><br>https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode9.0.0/ch18.pdf#page=23<br>https://github.com/cjkvi/cjkvi-ids<br>https://github.com/Transfusion/cjkvi-ids-unicode<br>http://kanji-database.sourceforge.net/

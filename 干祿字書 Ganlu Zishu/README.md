### "The Book of Dry Lu Characters"

☆ This article was originally supposed to be published last year, and the draft and upload have been completed. Unexpectedly, my father was hospitalized suddenly and was delayed. One year later, it is now slightly revised and officially released.
 "The Book of Qianlu Characters" is a book of Chinese characters in the Tang Dynasty, written by Yan Yuansun. After the writing was completed, when his nephew Yan Zhenqing served as Huzhou governor in the 9th year of the Tang Dynasty, the book "Gan Lu Zishu" was copied on the stone and stood in the east hall of the Huzhou governor for the first time. In the fourth year of Emperor Wenzong of Tang Dynasty, Yang Hangong had already damaged the stone by carving, and he helped Yan Zhenqing's nephew, Yan Yongyi, to reprint the rubbings in his early years. In August of Emperor Gaozong of the Song Dynasty, Shaoxing reenxu, the "Book of Dry Lu Characters" was carved in stone again, presided over by Yuwen Gong of Tongzhou Prefecture, and Professor Zixue Chengdu Gouyong used the sword for three inscriptions. The so-called "character learning book" is a book that publishes orthographic Chinese characters. The purpose is to provide officials and test-takers with the correct writing of words. It is almost equivalent to the modern "College Entrance Examination Book". The person who "dos" asks for it, and the person who "lu" is official, so it is called "The Book of Dry Lu".
 "Ganlu Zishu" classifies the collected Chinese characters according to their sounds, and then divides them into four parts. The characters of each part are arranged in order of the rhyme part, and the example of the order of the characters according to the sound is opened, which will become the mainstream of the future orthographic study. Mr. Liu Zhongfu compiled a total of 804 groups of Chinese characters in his book "Study on the Characters of the Book of Qianlu Characters", with 1656 characters in total, which is consistent with my collation.
 The text of "Gan Lu [Zishu](https://www.kanripo.org/text/KR1j0023/) " on the Internet is not difficult to find, for example: [Wikisource-Ganlu](https://zh.wikisource.org/zh/%E5%B9%B2%E7%A6%84%E5%AD%97%E6%9B%B8_(%E5%9B%9B%E5%BA%AB%E5%85%A8%E6%9B%B8%E6%9C%AC))[Zishu](https://www.kanripo.org/text/KR1j0023/)[(Siku Quanshu Ben)](https://zh.wikisource.org/zh/%E5%B9%B2%E7%A6%84%E5%AD%97%E6%9B%B8_(%E5%9B%9B%E5%BA%AB%E5%85%A8%E6%9B%B8%E6%9C%AC)) , [Kanripo Chinese リポジトリ: KR1j0023 Qianlu Zishu-Tang-Yan Yuansun](https://www.kanripo.org/text/KR1j0023/) , but because of this book There are many vulgar characters that have not been Unicode-encoded, so almost all the texts are pitted, and no version is intact and requires a glimpse of the original appearance.
 After finding the source of the text, I slowly began to collect many editions of ancient books and shadows, which took me a lot of time. [Harvard Library](https://hollis.harvard.edu/primo-explore/search?vid=HVD2&sortby=rank&lang=en_US) , [ancient sum of Waseda University](http://www.wul.waseda.ac.jp/kotenseki/index.html) , [Japan Library of Congress](http://dl.ndl.go.jp/) , [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) , [books grid](http://shuge.org/) , [Great Masters](http://www.guoxuedashi.com/) all I used to come to the ancient site. There are many editions of Qianlu Zishu. After filtering, the representative ones in each edition are sorted out according to the best, and a total of seven editions are obtained. Among them, the rubbings of the stele should be copied from the original calligraphy of Yan Zhenqing, and it is also a good calligraphy work to appreciate as a copybook.

-   "The Book of Qianlu Characters" Siku Quanshu
-   "The Book of Qianlu Characters" Chen Lansun wood block copy
-   Rubbings of the Stone Tablet of "The Book of Qianlu Characters"
-   "Book of Qianlu Characters" Tangshi Carved Edition
-   "Book of Qianlu Characters" Yimen Guangqi Edition
-   "The Book of Qianlu Characters" on Yu Ben
-   An empty copy of "The Book of Qianlu Characters" by Shamendao

There are more than 400 groups of headings and paragraphs in the original book, which is not too much. So after assessing the workload, I expected to do a comprehensive proofreading and correct all the missing words and typos. I hope to return the original face of this book. Add a reference tool for studying Chinese characters by yourself. The collected seven editions of ancient books and shadows are cut into PDFs, and the page numbers of each edition are indexed to facilitate proofreading.
 It took nearly four months to complete the work of proofreading and correction, punctuation sentence reading, supplementary writing, and finally split the prefix, add the prefix picture of the screenshot of Chen Lansun's engraved copy, and add the variant link, and completed the "Gan Lu Zishu" mdx dictionary. The page numbers have all been rearranged a second time, using a more refined pattern of lines and characters, which is more convenient for positioning. According to the newly created more than 200 supplementary characters, more than 90% of them also appear in the Variant Character Dictionary of the Ministry of Education, which can be used as an important reference for researchers of vulgar and variant characters.

Although the process was painstaking, it was very interesting. I read the "Book of Dry Lu Characters" and learned a lot of variants and vulgar characters, which was quite rewarding. Many Chinese characters that were regarded as orthodox in the Tang Dynasty have changed over the years, but they have become vulgar characters today. This is also an alternative portrayal of "In the old days, Wang Xie Tang Qianyan flew into the homes of ordinary people."

 [Note①] If the supplementary Chinese characters of "全宋体" are used in the dictionary, I will mark them as red letters to remind users to pay attention. These supplementary Chinese characters are not a general standard set by the Unicode official. Therefore, when quoting the content of the dictionary in formal occasions such as papers and works, please handle and mark them carefully so that the readers will not see the supplementary Chinese characters.

### "Kangxi Dictionary"

☆ On 12/11/2018, a friend suggested that the labels of "tone" and "example" should be separated by color, and the "example" should be unified with "tone", so the context is clear. I think this suggestion is good, so the color scheme has been modified. Please download the original link again.
 The "Opening Kangxi" edited by brother Zhipan brought great convenience to reference when reading. But maybe the text of the same textbook he used at the time was not clear enough and difficult to identify, and there were still many errors in the text. Later, a high-definition copy of Wu Yingdian (also known as Neifu Periodical) from the Harvard University Collection in the 55th year of Kangxi was obtained for comparison and verification. Due to the gradual revision and addition of other materials, the "Open Kangxi Dictionary" I produced has gradually been inconsistent with the original "Open Kangxi" data. In order to avoid confusion and misunderstandings, the "Open Kangxi Dictionary" has been officially renamed since last year. "Kangxi Dictionary". The new version of "Kangxi Dictionary" has comprehensively sorted the prefixes. All the ancient Kangxi script prefixes can be retrieved, and some Unicode prefixes that have not been encoded are also supplemented with supplementary words, which can be displayed and retrieved correctly.
 In order to facilitate positioning and verification, the revised "Kangxi Dictionary" has a font size for each prefix, ranging from 1 to 47043, marked on the upper right of the prefix, so that the styles of several ancient Chinese dictionaries are almost the same.

 In addition, all accompanied by the word head from [Hon Code](http://www.zdic.net/) site Kangxi prefix picture, more clearly shaped the appearance of the original book. The pictures of Kangxi prefixes in the Han Dian are not complete, there are omissions, and there are also misplants. I have reviewed this part in a rough and comprehensive way, taking screenshots and patching hundreds of pictures by myself.
 The new version of "Kangxi Dictionary" fully supports "Unrolled Barcode", as long as you have the corresponding scanned book shadow, click on the page number to automatically open the corresponding page, which is very convenient to compare with the original book. For details, please refer to " [Establishment of Chinese Characters Usage Environment (iv-Unfolding](https://fgwang.blogspot.com/2018/12/blog-post.html) )". After configuration, it can be used together.
 Wu Ying edition of pages of data taken from the [Great Masters](http://www.guoxuedashi.com/) website, but the original data error very much, I made a large-scale revision, the error rate is reduced to very low. The revised data was later fed back to the master of Guoxue through friends, and now the page code of the Neifu Journal on the website of the master of Guoxue is also the revised version. The page number data of "Kangxi Dictionary: Punctuation Collation" is also taken from the website of Masters of Chinese Studies. It has also been sorted and revised on a large scale, which is different from the website.
 The page number of "Kangxi Dictionary Textual Research" by Airitang was created with the help of brother suns99. The original textual research with the textbook bureau, the words are too small and vague, the words of Airitangben are much clearer.

(Ai Ri Tang Ben's "Kangxi Dictionary Textual Research")

 With the support and assistance of brother suns99, more than 1,700 pictures and words in the text of "Kangxi Open" were completely cleaned up. Restored six or seven hundred picture characters (mostly E and F area characters, brother Zhipan should not have E and F area characters when he was doing some school), and the rest should be some uncoded characters. The remaining picture characters, if the fonts are correct, still maintain the presentation of the picture characters, but the corresponding structure has been filed, and may be added to the supplementary character and component retrieval in the future; if the font is incorrect, the structure will be changed. The word form is presented and left for subsequent processing.
 Brother suns99 is still helping to correct the "Kangxi Dictionary". Many of the corrections were made by him (Wang Yinzhi and Watanabe Wenben have not corrected them), and I revised them one by one and added explanations (all changes to the original text of Kangxi) All places have school notes), special thanks here!

    There is a problem with this dictionary. When I use an iphone or ipad, I load it into Oulu or mdict and use it to query the word "No". The content in the circled "Note" cannot be displayed. I hover over the computer by the mouse. As you can see, how to make it display normally in ipad or iPhone? Thank you.

    Hello, when I check "Peng" in the Kangxi dictionary, some words can't be displayed and turned into boxes. I wonder if there is a solution? As shown:

    Hello, I would like to ask. If there is textual research under the text, the textual research part has not actually been changed to the text. For example, if you look up the word "enter", the following textual research is "I would like to change from Mencius to Mencius in the original book," but the text has not been changed in fact, and "Mencius" is still maintained. We speculate that this is because the following textual research is a later textual research text. The textual research text is attached for readers' reference when making this dictionary, but the text is the original version, so the text is still the original text. I wonder if our guess is correct? Thank you!

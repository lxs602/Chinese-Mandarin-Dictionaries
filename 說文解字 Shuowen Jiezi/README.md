### Dictionary of "Shuo Wen Jie Zi"

☆ 2019/02/15 Corrected some errors reported by netizens, and made slight adjustments to the features of the mobile APP. Please download the original link again.
 Five or six years ago, for the need of reading, I made the first version of the "Shu Wen Jie Zi" dictionary, but I have not been very satisfied. Until two years ago, the relevant production skills and experience gradually matured, so I decided to redo it. I used the offline version of the comprehensive retrieval system of "Shu Wen Jie Zi" donated by Mr. Jiang Menma as the manuscript, integrated the old version of the data, and roughly completed a prototype after revision and correction. In the following two years, it was expanded and revised successively, gradually forming the scale of today's dictionary. In order to allow more friends who are interested in Chinese characters to use this dictionary, with the consent of Teacher Jiang, it will be officially shared two years later today, hoping to help more friends understand the origin of some Chinese characters.

 The original data of this dictionary is mainly taken from the offline version of the comprehensive retrieval system of "Shu Wen Jie Zi" donated by Mr. Jiang Menma from the [depths of Baiyun](http://www.homeinmists.com/) . It has been revised and revised, and merged with data from several other sources. Mr. Jiang Menma, Ningbo, spent many years of time and energy to collect and sort out extremely complete information about Chinese characters and characters. I am very grateful for the gift, and any explanations and corrections during the production process.
 There are many flaws in the original data of the comprehensive retrieval system. For example, the page number of Chen Changzhi's root is converted from the four imposition page numbers, so there are only odd numbers and not even numbers. There are also many errors in the page numbers of the general training and deciding voices and saying the literary proof. With the help of brother suns99, he repaired the code of Chen Changzhi's page, and added the page numbers of "Shuowen Jiezi Correction" and "Shuowen Jiezi Annotation" (Xu Weixian's edition). There are also many errors and omissions in the text of the "Biography". Many parts of the manuscript "cloud" are mistaken for "cloud" and "xian" are mistaken for "xian", and have been manually checked. However, the text of "Duan Zhu" has many omissions, which is not ideal. Later, I found the github established by brother Zhipan. After large-scale revision, it replaced the missing paragraph text.
 The entire dictionary is based on three main works of "Shuowen Jiezi"-Da Xu edition, Xiao Xu edition ("Shuowen Jiezi Biography"), and Duan Annotation edition ("Shuowen Jie Zi Zhu"). The warp, and other auxiliary materials-book page numbers and related notes as wefts, interweave a dense reference network. Every time you inquire, you can see the similarities and differences of these three editions. If you have the book and shadow of each edition, you can quickly refer to the original appearance of various engraved editions. ", Gui Fu's "Shuowen Jiezi Yizheng", Wang Yun's "Shuwen Juyu", the page index of the "Four Masters of Shuowen" in the Qing Dynasty should be complete. For the study of "Shuowen Jiezi", this is A very convenient search tool.
 The text of Daxu's text has been revised many times by Teacher Jiang and is of the best quality. I took a screenshot of Ji Gu Ge's book to present the seal character part of the prefix. The more than 3,600 related notes mostly quoted the data of the [character evolution](http://xiaoxue.iis.sinica.edu.tw/yanbian) of the [elementary school](http://xiaoxue.iis.sinica.edu.tw/yanbian) (the original should be a Chinese dictionary), and then they were revised and supplemented.
 Xiao Xu's text is of poor quality and has many errors and omissions. It is basically based on Shugutang. For the seal character part of the prefix, I took a screenshot of Qi Liaozao's block-printed copy to present it.
 The original source of the commentary is the collation of Japanese scholars. Although it has been collated by many hands, there are still more than 3,000 missing characters to be filled. Later, Teacher Jiang came to help and recorded these missing words again, and Fang became the status quo. For the seal character part of the prefix, I took a screenshot of the Jingyun building to show it.
 Many online search tools of "Shuowen Jiezi" only have texts without the prefixes of seal characters. It should be noted that Xu Shen's entire "Shuowen Jiezi" is based on the form of Xiaozhuan characters. Without the comparison of seal characters, it is impossible to truly understand the connotation of "Shuowen". Therefore, when making this dictionary, I paid special attention to the part of seal characters, and tried to present it with screenshots of the original book, instead of using ready-made fonts (such as the Shuowen Xiaozhuan font of Beijing Normal University).
 The various book editions of ["Shuowen Jiezi"](http://www.homeinmists.com/shuowen/index.html) are described in detail in the webpage of ["Shuowen Jiezi" Comprehensive Retrieval System by](http://www.homeinmists.com/shuowen/index.html) Teacher Jiang , so I won't repeat them here. As for the page numbers of each book, in addition to the revised data inherited from Teacher Jiang, I also made a few new ones myself. Later, I received enthusiastic responses and support from a lot of friends. The ancient and modern related works have accumulated to more than 30 books ( It will continue to increase if there is a chance in the future), the table is as follows:

Thanks to Teacher Jiang, Jin Yun, Brother Hufeng, Brother Suns99, Brother Aliang, Brother Zhou Yu, Brother Weiming, there may be some friends who indirectly helped or I missed out. Without these friends, these results cannot be achieved.

 Duan Yucai's "Shuowen Jiezi Zhu" has revised a lot of Xu Wen's words, and even changed the prefixes of many seal characters. I have read many related papers and specially marked the prefixes of the modified seals of the Scriptures to remind me to pay more attention when reading them.

 numerous, after two years of accumulated bit by bit, I and several friends work together to complete this The revised version of the "Shuowen Jiezi" dictionary is now unconditionally shared publicly. I am happy to see the application in academic research, education, and personal reading, but please do not use it for any form of commercial profit . I hope that these valuable information can be used more conveniently by everyone, and friends who use it, please let me know about the defects and wrong reactions that I find, so that I can make subsequent corrections.
 Finally, attach some work logs recorded during the production process as a memory and souvenir:

-   2017/05/04 The integration of segment notes is completed, and there are still many defects. Missing characters that have not been entered are uniformly indicated by ※, and there are more than three thousand ※. There are nearly 500 pages in the page numbers of the Jingyunlou section, which need to be manually checked to sort out the word sequence of each page.
-   2017/05/05 Some of the seal characters in the Duan Zhu Ben are different from those in the Da Xu edition, so the seal pictures of the Duan Zhu Ben are integrated.
-   2017/05/09 阿良兄贊助兩本頁碼：《說文解字考正》、《說文解字今釋》。經韻樓本的頁碼梳理完成、訂出各頁字序。更動六百多個說文的代表字頭，儘量選用接近篆字字形的字元來做為代表字頭。

-   2017/06/06 利用小學堂數據再核對一次，調整近三百個通行字頭，補了三百多條遺漏附注，另增補 382 條說文新證(節錄)附注，附注數目來到 3680 條。另 19 個新修字加上標註、訂正若干錯誤。
-   2017/06/09 利用多份數據來還原《章太炎說文解字授課筆記》紙本順序頁碼、訂出各頁字序，筆記的部首部分目前沒有加進來。
-   2017/10/30 州吁兄提供了《說文解字探原》、《說文解字集注》兩份頁碼索引。
-   2017/12/18 收到 蔣老師的《說文解字注》校訂文本，花了兩天時間重新整理、吻合。根據 蔣老師的整理，新增了兩個段注 "假" 字頭。
-   2018/11/05 完成《說文解字(施謝捷版)》。根據網上流傳甚久的一份 Word 文件所做，作者為古典文獻的專業學者施謝捷教授。內文綜合了大、小徐，極有參考價值。(未得施謝捷教授同意前，不對外發布分享)
-   2018/11/08 偉明兄提供了《古文字釋要》、州吁兄提供了《說文新附通誼》頁碼索引。
-   2019/01/28 It took a week to sort out and put the seal characters in the "Biography". Brother suns99 provided the punctuation compilation of "Shuowen Jiezi", and brother Weiming provided the page number of the punctuation and phonetic "Shuowen Jiezi".
-   2019/02/25 It took two days to rearrange and match the page numbers of the other version of "Tongxun Dingsheng" provided by Teacher Jiang, and replace the page numbers of the old version of "Tongxun Dingsheng" with many errors.

(The work log is not complete, sometimes it’s lazy, sometimes it’s forgotten to record, haha!)

 [Note①] If the supplementary Chinese characters of "全宋体" are used in the dictionary, I will mark them as red letters to remind users to pay attention. These supplementary Chinese characters are not a general standard set by the Unicode official. Therefore, when quoting the content of the dictionary in formal occasions such as papers and works, please handle and mark them carefully so that the readers will not see the supplementary Chinese characters.

        Hello, there are these remarks in the comprehensive retrieval system of "Shu Wen Jie Zi" by Mr. Jiang. I am not sure who came from it (perhaps it is Mr. Jiang’s reading notes), so it is temporarily recorded in "Mr. Jiang’s account", the name is " Jiang Note", ha ha!

        I have verified with Teacher Jiang that these remarks were indeed added by Teacher Jiang.

    Thank you for selflessly sharing such a useful dictionary. Thank you very much!
    I would like to ask you:
    1. I usually prefer to use the GoldenDict dictionary software on my computer, but in this software, the page numbers of the folded versions in this dictionary cannot be opened, and the PDF cannot be opened through GoPage even by clicking the visible page number.
    2. Continuing, in GoldenDict, the fonts of all fonts cannot be displayed normally, and they are all tofu.
    Do you know how to solve the above problem?
    Of course, there is no such problem if you switch to MDict, but GoldenDict has more functions. If you can only use this software, it will be more convenient.
    Thanks again for sharing!

    [Dictionary of "Shuo Wen Jie Zi"](http://fgwang.blogspot.com/2019/02/blog-post.html)
    ☆ 2019/02/15 Corrected some errors reported by netizens, and made slight adjustments to the features of the mobile APP. Please download the original link again. Five or six years ago, for the need of reading, I made the first version of the "Shu Wen Jie Zi" dictionary, but I have not been very satisfied. Until two years ago, the relevant production skills and experience gradually matured, so I decided to redo it. I used the "Shu Wen Jie Zi" donated by Teacher Jiang Menma to synthesize...

    ["Kangxi Dictionary"](http://fgwang.blogspot.com/2018/12/blog-post_10.html)
    ☆ On 12/11/2018, a friend suggested that the labels of "tone" and "example" should be separated by color, and the "example" should be unified with "tone", so the context is clear. I think this suggestion is good, so the color scheme has been modified. Please download the original link again. The "Opening Kangxi" written by brother Zhipan brought great convenience to reference when reading. But maybe the text of the same textbook he used at the time was not clear enough and difficult to recognize, and there were still many texts...

    [The establishment of the environment for the use of Chinese characters (iv)-open volume](http://fgwang.blogspot.com/2018/12/blog-post.html)
    When I search a dictionary, I often need to further refer to the original book and shadow of the dictionary, especially some ancient text books, dictionaries, and rhyme books. On the one hand, there may still be errors and omissions in the textualized text. On the other hand, it may be that the original book still has some content that is difficult to present in text, such as some fonts, styles, illustrations, etc. But if you still have to manually go through the books one by one, it is difficult and inefficient. The MDict dictionary brings fast...

    [Open Kangxi offline dictionary](http://fgwang.blogspot.com/2015/03/blog-post.html)
    因著開始閱讀詩經的緣故，每逢發現了可以輔助閱讀的相關資料，我便會想辦法將它轉製成 MDict 離線辭典以方便查找，算算這兩年多來也累積製作了超過三十餘部的大小辭典。在我做的這些辭典之中，"康熙字典" 的製作要算是波折最多的一部了。

    隨著兩年多來閱讀詩經的持續進行，我對這些古老詩歌的閱讀深度也自然而然地逐步加強。有時候我會翻遍手邊所有的辭典，只為了對某一個單字或複詞的意義有更深入的理解。這時候，我自己收集製作的七、八部離線辭典通常就能幫上大忙，讓我可以方便、可靠地查到我想要找的資料。不過現有的幾部主力辭典基本...
